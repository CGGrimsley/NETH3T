## **Project Overview**
This project aims to create a **multifunctional, portable penetration testing device** inspired by the capabilities of the **Flipper Zero**, but with enhanced functionality. The device leverages the **DSTIKE D-duino 32 (ESP32-based)** microcontroller and integrates several RF, NFC/RFID, IR, and Wi-Fi testing capabilities. It allows users to perform **Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks**, **RF signal sniffing and jamming**, **NFC/RFID cloning**, and **IR signal replaying**, all while being compact, portable, and flexible.

### This is the chart when using a Dstike D-Duino 32 II with a MCP23017 IO expander. Your board may differ!
You may need to create a BUS to wire some modules together for some boards such as I2C, SPI components, power and ground. 
Make sure that your board can provide enough power for this to function!
You may also need to use Multiplexors/I2C expanders for some boards so shop accordingly!




### **Building and Flashing the Firmware**
Once the hardware is wired and the software dependencies are installed, you can build and flash the firmware to the device.
